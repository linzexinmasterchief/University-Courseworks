This system supports books checkout and return completely based on GUI
interface, which has been designed carefully to be as easy to use as possible.
After the program started, the main page will be loaded and display two
input fields. The upper one is for searching books, you can either search by
book name or book id, the system will automatically notice the difference.
Since the id is a special piece of string, normally looks like: "x_y", for 
example, "123_2" represents that this book has a general id "123" and a special
id "2". The general id represents a group of books that are all identical, just
have many copies. Therefore the special id is for locating one particular copy.
Together, they made up an unique id for the book.
You will also notice that the search algorithm supports in-accurate searching,
you can just enter a part of the book's title, and the system will automatically
give out a list of possible options, listing in the order of popularity.
More details about the book will also be revealed if you click on the "more"
button of any one of the books. all the copies of this book will be displayed
and there is also a chart showing the trend of this book, how much has it been
borrowed within a certain amount of time.
All the books that haven't been borrowed could be add to a cart and checkout at
the same time. Of course, you need to enter the member id, which is a 4-digit
number

The return process is even more simpler, you only need to enter the book id in the 
lower entry box and press confirm, if your book id is correct then the return
process is already done. Otherwise you need to check if there is any spell error.
